Nod Adventure
=============

Nod Adventure, an interactive fiction game by Dan Church.

This was created as my final project for my C# class. It isn't finished yet.

Disclaimer
----------

I am a definite n00b at C#, so this program may not be as efficient as it
should be, and I have probably missed out on some advantages of C# that I could
have taken.

There aren't any guarantees that this code will even compile; it's a definite
work in progress.
