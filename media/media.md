creepy*.wav
-----------

Begin with completely null waveform, pipe everything through CAPS "C* Lorenz"
LADSPA plugin (caps.so) by Tim Goetze <tim@quitte.de> with the parameters set
thusly:

h: 0.25
x: 1.0
y: 0.0
z: 0.0
volume: 0.5

(These are the default settings.)

You now have creepy.wav. Repeat for creepy2.wav, and again for creepy3.wav.
