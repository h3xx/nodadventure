Two empty containers:

* one with five gallons capacity,

* another with three gallons of capacity

Player can only use these to achieve the four gallons of liquid weight filling
them from an unlimited supply of liquid.

Solution
--------

Fill the 5 gallons container to top, then drop it to fill the 3 gallons. The 5
gallons container will now have two remaining gallons of water, and the 3 gallon
container will be filled.

Now empty the 3 gallons container.

After emptying it, pour the two gallons that are still in the 5 gallon
container into the, now empty, 3 gallons container.

The 3 gallon container now has two gallons of water, and the 5 gallons
container is empty.

Fill the 5 gallons container to top.

Since the 3 gallons container still has two gallons of water, from our previous operation, it will only allow for 1 gallon more. Pour the 5 five gallons container into the 3 gallons one.
