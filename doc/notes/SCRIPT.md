Nod Adventures Script
=====================

This is a rough draft for the script for the Nod Adventures game. This isn't
meant to be a definitive document, merely prose to guide the creation of the
game's structures.

Act 1
-----

You wake up in a darkened hotel room. The first thing you see is the ceiling.
You feel around and realize you're lying in a hotel bed. You have no idea how
you got there. You reach to the nightstand and pull the small chain to turn on
the lamp. You sit up in bed. Your head hurts.

You look at the clock. You've been asleep all afternoon and it's already dark.
Funny, you don't feel like you got a good night's sleep, or any sleep at all
for that matter.

You look at the nightstand and see a picture of yourself holding a red herring.

You search around the room for clues, but only find your toothbrush and a
bottle of aspirin. You search your luggage but only find some

FIXME

While you're sitting on the bed trying to remember where you were before here, the light on the nightstand goes out with an audible pop.
